# DAPNET EMF Camp schedule announcer

Sends EMF camp event announcements via DAPNET.

This is typically deployed via the emfcamp [rubric](https://hampager.de/dokuwiki/doku.php#rubrics) (rubric number 67, RIC 1067).
If you are attending EMF, have your pager tuned to 439.9875 MHz and listed to RIC 1067 and it should "just work".
